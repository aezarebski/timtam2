#+title: TimTam

This repository is an attempt to implement the [[https://github.com/aezarebski/timtam][TimTam]] likelihood as a BEAST2
package. There is a [[*Vignette][vignette]] demonstrating how to use this.

* Remaining tasks and open problems

1. AVOID USING THE SAME PACKAGE PATHS!
2. Use proper dates on the nodes and point process to avoid needing to
   pre-compute these for the XML
3. Make the vignette easier to run and make it easier to generate the XML from a
   dataset.
4. Include an example where the tree is estimated as well.
5. Include the capability to parameterise this in terms of \(R_{0}\).
6. Set up a BEAUTi template.
   - This may require reading up on how to use Swing.

* Vignette

* Classes

Here is a description of the classes that are provided by the package.

** =beast.evolution.speciation=

*** =TimTam=

This class extends the =TreeDistribution= and implements the tree prior. It uses
the [[*=TreeWithPointProcess=]] class to help it traverse the data.

*** =TimTamLogger=

This class implements =Loggable= and is used to record the prevalence at each
MCMC step.

** =beast.evolution.tree.birthdeath=

*** =EventType=

This class describes the kinds of events that can be observed under the TimTam
likelihood.

*** =PointProcess= and =Schedule=

These classes are really just aliases to =RealParameter= as a way to make their
meaning clearer. The =PointProcess= stores the occurrence times and the
=Schedule= is used to indicate when there was a scheduled sample.

*** =TreeWithPointProcess=

This class extends the =CalculationNode= and provides functionality for
computing the times between observed events. This requires a tree, the origin
time and a =TraitSet= which is what we use to describe unsequenced observations.

* Structure

Figure [[example-dag]] shows an example of how =TimTam= and =TreeWithPointProcess=
nodes might be used in a model, ie the nodes represent =CalculationNode=
objects. The darker blue nodes are from the classes provided by this package.
The =PointProcess= node represents the times at which there was an unsequenced
observation and the =Schedule= node records when there was a scheduled sequenced
sample. The =RootLength= is really a =RealParameter= but this has not been given
its own class yet.
