#+title: TimTam

This repository is an attempt to implement the [[https://github.com/aezarebski/timtam][TimTam]] likelihood as a BEAST2
package. There is a [[*Vignette][vignette]] demonstrating how to use this.

* Remaining tasks and open problems

1. AVOID USING THE SAME PACKAGE PATHS!
2. Improve the operators used in the examples.
   - Currently only up/down operators work but not random walk or scaling ones.
3. Use proper dates on the nodes and point process to avoid needing to
   pre-compute these for the XML
   - The [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html][phangorn]] package can simulate sequences on a tree.
   - There is a Taming the Beast [[https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Molecular-Dating-Tutorial/][tutorial]] which looks at dates on nodes.
4. Make the vignette easier to run and make it easier to generate the XML from a
   dataset.
   - This is being blocked by not being able to compile the package outside of
     IntelliJ
   - This will be easier if there is a Beauti template
5. Set up a BEAUTi template.
   - This may require reading up on how to use Swing.
   - This should probably wait until there is a better way to specify node and
     occurrence times.
6. Include the capability to parameterise this in terms of \(R_{0}\).
7. Support heterogeneous rates

* Classes

Here is a description of the classes that are provided by the package.

** =beast.evolution.speciation=

*** =TimTam=

This class extends the =TreeDistribution= and implements the tree prior.

*** =TimTamLogger=

This class implements =Loggable= and is used to record the prevalence at each
MCMC step.

** =beast.evolution.tree.birthdeath=

*** =EventType=

This class describes the kinds of events that can be observed under the TimTam
likelihood.

*** =BackwardsPointProcess= and =BackwardsSchedule=

These classes are really just aliases to =RealParameter= as a way to make their
meaning clearer. The =BackwardsPointProcess= stores the occurrence times and the
=BackwardsSchedule= is used to indicate when there was a scheduled sample.

*** =TreeWithBackwardsPointProcess=

This class extends the =CalculationNode= and provides functionality for computing
the times between observed events. This requires a tree, the origin time and a
=TraitSet= which is what we use to describe unsequenced observations.

* Structure

Figure [[example-dag]] shows an example of how the classes provided by the package
fit together to define an analysis. The =RootLength= is really a =RealParameter= but
this has not been given its own class yet.
