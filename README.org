This repository is an attempt to implement the [[https://github.com/aezarebski/timtam][TimTam]] likelihood (described in
the PLOS Computational Biology [[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009805][paper]]) as a BEAST2 package. There are [[file:./doc/vignettes/readme.org::*Vignettes][vignettes]]
demonstrating how to use this. There is also a [[file:./doc/vignettes/readme.org::*Glossary][glossary]] for definitions specific
to TimTam.

* Remaining tasks and open problems

1. Re-run the vignettes using XML generated by Beauti rather than the hand
   crafted versions currently given.
   - [ ] Fixed tree without \(\rho\)-sample
   - [ ] Estimated tree with \(\rho\)-sample
   - [ ] Estimated tree without \(\rho\)-sample
2. Use proper dates on the nodes and point process to avoid needing to
   pre-compute these for the XML
   - The [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html][phangorn]] package can simulate sequences on a tree.
   - There is a Taming the Beast [[https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Molecular-Dating-Tutorial/][tutorial]] which looks at dates on nodes.
3. Include the capability to parameterise this in terms of \(R_{0}\).
4. Support heterogeneous rates
5. Include support for occurrence times in Beauti.

* Structure

Figure [[example-dag]] shows an example of how the classes provided by the package
fit together to define a model. The =RootLength= is really a =RealParameter= but
this has not been given its own class yet.
