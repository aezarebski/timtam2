This repository is an attempt to implement the [[https://github.com/aezarebski/timtam][TimTam]] likelihood (described in
the PLOS Computational Biology [[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009805][paper]]) as a BEAST2 package. There are [[file:./doc/vignettes/readme.org::*Vignettes][vignettes]]
demonstrating how to use this. There is also a [[file:./doc/vignettes/readme.org::*Glossary][glossary]] for definitions specific
to TimTam.

* Remaining tasks and open problems

1. Re-run the vignettes using XML generated by Beauti rather than the hand
   crafted versions currently given.
2. Use proper dates on the nodes and point process to avoid needing to
   pre-compute these for the XML
   - The [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html][phangorn]] package can simulate sequences on a tree.
   - There is a Taming the Beast [[https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Molecular-Dating-Tutorial/][tutorial]] which looks at dates on nodes.
3. Support heterogeneous rates

* Structure

Figure [[example-dag]] shows an example of how the classes provided by the package
fit together to define a model. The =RootLength= is really a =RealParameter= but
this has not been given its own class yet.
