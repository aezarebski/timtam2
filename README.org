#+title: TimTam

This repository is an attempt to implement the [[https://github.com/aezarebski/timtam][TimTam]] likelihood as a BEAST2
package. As a first pass we will only consider "unscheduled" data since this is
easier and is still useful.

* Remaining tasks and open problems

1. AVOID USING THE SAME PACKAGE PATHS!
2. Work out how to encode the relative timing properly.
   - Use =TraitSet= to put correct dates on the leaves.
   - Use =DateParameter= to put correct dates on the points.
     + There is an example in =feast= for how to do this.
   - Double check that this gets the internal nodes and root correct.
3. Finish the implementation of the likelihood which is currently blocked
   because there isn't a negative binomial distribution.
4. Figure out how to return additional data from the [[*=TimTam=]] class when
   running MCMC. This should be incorporated into an example too.
5. Set up a BEAUTi template.
   - This may require reading up on how to use Swing.

* Classes

Here is a description of the classes that are provided by the package.

** =beast.evolution.speciation=

*** =TimTam=

This class extends the =TreeDistribution= and implements the tree prior that we
care about. It uses the [[*=TreeWithPointProcess=]] class to help it navigate the
data.

TimTam has a nested class, =NegativeBinomial=, which is used to model the number
of hidden lineages.

** =beast.evolution.tree.birthdeath=

*** =EventType=

This class describes the kinds of events that can be observed under the TimTam
likelihood.

*** =TreeWithPointProcess=

This class extends the =CalculationNode= and provides functionality for
computing the times between observed events. This requires a tree, the origin
time and a =TraitSet= which is what we use to describe unsequenced observations.

* Example

Figure [[example-dag]] shows an example of how =TimTam= and =TreeWithPointProcess=
nodes might be used in a model, ie the nodes represent =CalculationNode=
objects. The darker blue nodes are from the classes provided by this package.
